            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE ANSWER OF THE GOLD-BEATERS OF LONDON, TO THE Grieuances exhibited by the Cutlers, Painters, and Booke-binders, againſt <hi>them and their Charter of Jncorporation.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <hi>TO the firſt, for that by their Charter of incorporation, the importation of beaten Gold and Siluer is restrained:</hi> They anſwere, That the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of beaten gold and ſiluer, wrought in papers is expreſly prohibited by the ſtatute of 1. <hi>R.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. And the ſame being baſe ſtuffe, and deceitfull, was only vſed by Painters and Bookebinders: and ſuch beaten gold and ſiluer as Cutlers vſe in their trade, was neuer imported from forraine parts, but made by the Goldbeaters of London. If the Cutlers ſhould vſe any of the imported gold or ſiluer, the ſame were againſt the intention of the ſaid ſtatute of 1. <hi>R.</hi> the 3. <hi>Cap.</hi> 12. and alſo the ſtatute of 5. <hi>Eliz. Cap.</hi> 7. made for the maintenance of handicrafts and manuell trades, amongſt which the trade of gold-beating is to be numbred, for that the ſaid foliate gold and ſiluer is made only with the labor of the ſingle hand, by continuall beating of forraine bullion with a hammer of 18. pound waight.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the ſecond, for that they being vnder the number of</hi> 30. <hi>perſons, haue obtayned by the meanes of</hi> M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. Doctor Egliſham, one of his Maieſties Phyſitians, <hi>a Charter of incorporation vnto themſelues, for the ſole making of gold and ſiluer foliate, and a proclamation prohibiting the importation of any ſuch gold into this kingdome: and that they haue entred into agreement to pay and allow vnto</hi> Doctor Egliſham, <hi>and</hi> S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> Henry Bretton, <hi>ſundry ſummes of mony yearly for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the ſaid Charter:</hi> For anſwere thereunto they ſay, That the myſtery of gold-beating hath beene an ancient and ſetled trade, within this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome many hundred yeares; as by ancient Records ready to be ſhewed forth may appeare. And the ſaid trade is of ſuch vſe, as the ſame is not to be aboliſhed, and therefore it was lawfull for them to procure a Charter of incorporation, for good order and gouernment of their trade, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent fraudes and deceipts, as it hath beene done for other trades within the City of London. And for ſuch rewards or gratuities as they haue giuen for procuring thereof, the ſame hath beene out of their owne eſtates, and no more then other trades vpon their incorporations haue done. And deny all combination and confederacy or the procuring of any proclamation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the third, wherein the Goldbeaters are charged to ſpend or conſume of the proper coynes or bullion of this kingdome, in making of the ſaid foliate three or fourethouſand pound per annü:</hi> For anſwer therunto they ſay, That they ſpend only forraine bullion to the value of two thouſand fiue hundred pound, and no more, wherewith, all England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, are ſerued and furniſhed: And that it is expreſly prouided by the Charter, that no Engliſh coyne or bullion ſhall be by them ſpent in making of the ſaid foliate. And it is alſo prouided by the ſaid Charter, That no free man of the ſayd trade ſhall beate any gold before he hath entred into bond of ſiue hundred pound, in the Exchequer, not to ſpend or conſume any engliſh coynes or bullion in the ſaid trade.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the fourth, that the complainants, ſince the incorporation of the Goldbeaters, are inforced to giue higher rates &amp; prices, then before they wre wont to pay for the ſayd foliate gold and ſiluer.</hi> For anſwere thereunto they ſay, That it is prouided by the ſaid Charter, that the ſame ſhall be ſold at ſuch reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble prices as the ſame was ſold for 20. yeeres paſt, hauing regard to the raiſing of his Maieſties Standard, and the ſaid complainants are ſerued with the ſame vnder the ſaid rate. For then they paid for a hundred of gold, 13. ſhillings 4. pence, and for a hundred of Siluer, 3. ſhillings 4. pence: at which time the rate of the Standard, for gold was three pound the ounce, and ſiluer, fiue ſhillings two pence the ounce. And the rate of the Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard being now for gold 3. pound 14. ſhillings 6. pence, and for Siluer ſix ſhillings. The complainants pay to the goldbeaters for gold, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boue the rate of 15. <abbr>s.</abbr> the hundred; and for ſiluer not aboue 3. s. the hundred. And ſince the ſaid Incorporation the gold &amp; ſiluer foliate is more ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall, larger, and in all points more ſufficient, then is was in former times. And the ſaid Goldbeaters neuer threatned the complainants to raiſe the prices.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:151065:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> 
               <hi>To the fift, for that the Goldbeaters confine the ſale of the ſaid gold and ſiluer foliate to one place which they call their hall:</hi> For anſwere they ſay, That it is prouided by the ſaid charter of incorporation, for the avoyding of all baſe and deceiptfull ſtuffe, that the ſame ſhould be brought to the Hall of the Goldbeaters, to be viewed, and there ſold by the Wardens of the company for the eaſe and benefit of his Majeſties ſubiects, that haue occaſion to vſe the ſame, And the ſaid Wardens do make no priuate gaine to themſelues.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the Sixth, that ſince the obtayning of the ſaid incorporation, the ſaid foliate gold and ſiluer is made more thinne and deceitfull then the ſame was before.</hi> For anſwere they ſay. That the gold and ſiluer foliate made ſince the ſaid incorporation, is as large and thicke and as pure ſubſtantiall and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like as the ſame was at any time before, and for the pureneſſe and goodneſſe thereof is without all exception.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the ſeuenth: Touching a ſuppoſed wrong done vnto one</hi> Spencer, <hi>a Gold-Beater, for troubling and arreſting him, and for exhibiting a bill into the Star-Chamber againſt him, and ſome of the Complainants, for vexation ſake.</hi> For anſwer they ſay; That the ſayd <hi>Spencer</hi> was the firſt, that drew the whole Company to proſecute the obtaining of the ſayd Charter, and was named one of the Wardens in the ſayd Charter, and tooke the Oath appoynted by the ſayd Charter, and agreed to beare his ratable part of the charge of paſſing the ſame, and afterwards to bring in his ratable part for a generall ſtocke for the whole Company, and alſo to attend at the Hall, with the reſt of the Wardens, to view ſuch worke as ſhould bee brought in by the Company, and to ſerue ſuch as came to buy gold and ſiluer leafe: And according to his ſayd agreement, he became bound in ſeuerall obligations, of fiue hundred pound a peece, to the other fiue Wardens; and likewiſe the fiue Wardens, in the like bonds to him, to performe the like agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Howbeit, when the Charter was paſſed, the ſayd <hi>Spencer,</hi> by the practice of the Complainants, denyed to pay his ratable part of the charge, of paſſing the Charter; or to bring in his rate for ſtocke, according to his bonds; or to giue his attendance at the Hall, as the reſt did, and priuately wrought baſe and deceitfull ſtuffe, mixt with copper, and would haue deliuered the ſame into the Hall, for pure gold, which the reſt of the Wardens refuſing, he thereupon (contrary to his ſayd oath) brake from his Company, vowing (as he had beene the principall meanes to procure the Charter) he would doe his beſt to ouerthrow it. And the ſaid <hi>Spencer,</hi> through the abetment and incouragement of ſome of the ſaid Complainants, did dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly endeuour, to draw diuers others of the Gold-beaters from their Company to ioyne with him: For which wrongs the Gold-beaters did, in a legall courſe, arreſt the ſaid <hi>Spencer</hi> vpon his bonds: And did likewiſe proſecute the ſaid Bill in the Star-Chamber, againſt the ſayd <hi>Spencer,</hi> and two of the ſayd Cutlers and their wiues, for vnlawfull maintenance, practice, and confederacie, to deſtroy their ſayd trade: Wherunto the Defendants did put in a Demurrer, which depends in reference.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To the eighth: That the ſayd Charter, for incorporating the Gold-Beaters, is in the nature of a Monopolie.</hi> For anſwer they ſay. That it cannot be denied, but that the trade of the Gold-Beaters is very ancient, and of great vſe, and therefore to incorporate the ſame, is very lawfull and conuenient. For the generall forme of the Charter, the ſame is agreeable with the ordinary forme of Incorporations of other Trades in <hi>London,</hi> and euery one of them may aſwell be charged, with ſauouring of a Monopolie, as this. If any clauſe in this Charter be againſt the Law, or to the preiudice of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, the ſame is voyd, and doth not binde. And the ſame (if any ſuch be) may bee reformed, by renewing of the ſayd Charter, and omitting ſuch clauſe. But to diſſolue the Incorporation, and to leaue the Trade without order and gouernment, were vtterly to deſtroy the ſame.</p>
            <p>Whereof the ſayd Gold-Beaters doe moſt humbly pray, that due conſideration may be had.</p>
            <p>The ground of the Complainants griefe is, by reaſon the Gold-Beaters are incorporated, and not vpon any other cauſe. For before their Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration, the ſayd rates and prices of Foliate Gold and ſiluer, were vnknowne to his Maieſties ſubiects. And the Gold-Beaters being but few in number, and their dwelling vncertaine, the Complainants buying the ſayd Foliate gold and ſiluer of the Gold-Beaters, at baſe and low rates, did vent and ſell the ſame in their works, at double and treble the prices they payd, and thereby enriched themſelues, and impoueriſhed the ſayd Gold-Beaters. But ſince the Incorporation, the prices of the ſayd gold and ſiluer Foliate, and the place of the ſale thereof being certaine and knowne, the ſayd Complainants doe feare (as there is iuſt cauſe) that the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdome, and ſuch others, as ſhall vſe Foliate gold and ſiluer, will make their owne prouiſion, and ſee the ſame wrought. And thereby the exceſſiue gaines of the Complainants bee abated and brought downe. <hi>All which ſhall be auerred vpon oath vnto this honourable Aſſembly: For whoſe proſperity and honour the ſaid Company of Gold-beaters daily pray.</hi>
